# CODSOFT
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the CodeSoft Internship focused on Machine Learning! This repository contains the projects and learning progress I completed as part of my internship with CodeSoft, demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, model building, and real-world problem-solving using ML techniques.
Task 01 – Movie Genre Prediction Using Text Classification
In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary and other textual information. The workflow included text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The goal was to transform raw movie plot text into meaningful numerical features and apply supervised learning to classify each plot into one or more genres. This task demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in real-world classification problems.

Task 02 – Credit Card Fraud Detection
In this task, I built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing anonymized transaction features. The objective was to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, addressing the common challenge of class imbalance in fraud detection.

The workflow involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on minimizing false negatives in fraud detection.

This project highlights the application of supervised learning in a critical, real-world financial security scenario.

Task 03 – Customer Churn Prediction
In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data. The dataset included features such as usage behavior, demographics, and account activity, which were used to identify patterns associated with customer retention and churn.

After preprocessing the data and performing exploratory analysis, I trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. The goal was to build a model that can accurately flag customers likely to churn, helping businesses take proactive steps to improve retention.

This project demonstrates the use of predictive analytics in solving real-world business problems through classification techniques.
